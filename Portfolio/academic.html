  <h1>Exemplary Academic Work</h1>
  <p>
    A curated collection of my most significant individual and group projects completed during my Bachelor of Science in Information Systems journey.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through these academic experiences, I developed a broad set of technical and analytical skills. The works presented highlight my growth in programming, system analysis and design, electronics prototyping, and collaborative project development, representing the most impactful outputs of my academic training.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Individual Work -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Individual Academic Work</h2>

  <h3>Programming Exercises (Python, C++, C#, Unity)</h3>
  <p>
    These exercises strengthened my understanding of algorithms, control structures,
    object-oriented programming concepts, and error handling. Using Unity alongside
    traditional programming languages allowed me to apply logic, scripting, and
    interactive system design through hands-on development.
  </p>

  <h3>Website & UI Design</h3>
  <p>
    I designed multiple HTML/CSS user interfaces and prototypes, experimenting with
    responsive layouts, visual hierarchy, and user-centered design principles. This
    provided practical experience in web structure, usability, and accessibility.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Group Work -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Group Academic Work</h2>

  <h3>Elevating Budget Hotels: Integrated Web and Mobile Solutions for Guest and Operational Management (Capstone)</h3>
<p>
  We developed two integrated systems: a <strong>mobile app</strong> for guests to enhance their hotel experience and a <strong>web app</strong> for hotel staff to improve daily operations. Both applications share a single database hosted on Aiven Cloud, enabling real-time updates between guest actions and staff workflows.
</p>
<p>
  These applications address key issues such as long queues, delays during check-in and check-out, and inefficiency in handling guest requests. 
</p>
<p>
  My primary contributions included <strong>frontend and backend development, QA/testing</strong>, and I served as the <strong>team leader</strong>, coordinating tasks, ensuring quality standards, and guiding team members throughout the project lifecycle.
</p>

 <h3>System Analysis & Design</h3>
<p>
  I worked closely with my team to create detailed system diagrams, gather requirements, conduct feasibility studies, and model workflows. This experience enhanced my skills in problem analysis, solution design, and applying structured approaches to technology projects.
</p>

<h3>Research Presentations</h3>
<p>
  I contributed to multiple research-focused group projects, preparing and delivering presentations, defending our findings, and effectively communicating complex information. These activities strengthened my analytical thinking, collaboration, and public speaking abilities.
</p>

<h3>Case Studies & Reports</h3>
<p>
  I engaged in team-based assessments involving case studies, formal reports, and multimedia presentations. Through these tasks, I honed my technical writing, project coordination, and critical problem-solving skills.
</p>

 <h2>Game Development Projects</h2>

  <h3>Aphelion: Cats & Dragons (Unity Game Project)</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Aphelion: Cats & Dragons</strong> is an academic game project developed using
    <strong>Unity</strong>, showcasing interactive gameplay mechanics, character behavior,
    and collaborative development. The project focused on combining creative game design
    with technical programming concepts.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a <strong>programmer</strong>, my responsibilities included
    implementing core gameplay systems, scripting character controls and interactions,
    managing game logic, and integrating assets within the Unity engine. I also assisted
    in coordinating tasks, guiding team members, and ensuring the project met its
    functional and academic requirements.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project strengthened my skills in Unity scripting, problem-solving,
    teamwork, and applying programming concepts in an interactive and real-time
    environment.
